# Covert-Communication-Project
ECS132 Final Project 

This is the final project for my Probability and Statistics Class (ECS132). It answers several coding prompts given in order to create a covert communication channel. 
The goal was to design a method for modulating bits of a secret message into inter-packet delays such that outsiders could not view/discover the channel. This project was created in both Python and R.
